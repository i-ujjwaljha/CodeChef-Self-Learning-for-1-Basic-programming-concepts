# CodeChef-Self-Learning-for-1-Basic-programming-concepts
LINK TO THE PROBLEM SET: https://www.codechef.com/selflearning/1to2stars

The main purpose of this repository is to provide the solution to the Self Learning (for 1 star Coders) who are finding difficulties to solve those given questions. 
So I attempted those questions and wrote their solutions in this repo to keep them organised and in the same place. 
I want you to comment if you find any problem with the provided solutions so that I can improve on that and I will also get to learn something new.
